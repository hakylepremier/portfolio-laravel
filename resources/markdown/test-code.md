# Typography should be easy

Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with tailwind has beem a tedious task that required a kean eye for typography an a lot of complex custom css.

This is to test how the paragraphs would work.

## Another section

This is how I want to test the **blogquote**

> Listen my friends, don't be fooled by my constant talks, what I say may not be true today but who knows when it'll be, so listen my friends.

This is just to end the section.

## Some code

We have js:

```js
console.log("Hello");
```

We have php:

```php
protected $attributes = [
  'published' => true,
  'released' => false,
];
```

We have css

```css
.name {
    color: var(--color-primary);
    font-weight: 800;
    text-decoration: none;
}
```

We have html

```html
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">The projects I've worked on</h1>
```

This is to end it

```html
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">The projects I've worked on</h1>
```

```html
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">The projects I've worked on</h1>
```

The end

## A list section

This shows a list of fruit

-   Apple
-   Pineapple
-   Banana

This shows an _ordered_ list

1. class 1
2. class 2
3. class 3

## Some section

This is to test how the paragraphs would work.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Text     | Text     | Text     |
